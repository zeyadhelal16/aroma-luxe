purchase products in a modern and interactive environment. The platform is designed to provide a smooth shopping experience with a clean user interface and responsive design.

The application includes a Dark Mode feature for better user comfort and a language switch option (Arabic / English) to make the platform accessible to a wider audience. Users can add products to their cart, complete real purchases, and view accurate stock availability. When a product is running low or out of stock, the remaining quantity is clearly displayed to ensure transparency.

The front-end was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, creating a dynamic and responsive user interface. The back-end is built with .NET, handling business logic, product management, and secure transaction processing.

This project demonstrates strong full-stack development skills, including multilingual support, theme management, real-time stock handling, and seamless integration between front-end and back-end systems.
